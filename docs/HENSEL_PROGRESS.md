## Source boundary checked in this run

The source starts with a one-variable Newton improvement lemma for
`f ∈ Z_p[X]`.  If `x ∈ Z_p`, `n,k ∈ Z`, `0 ≤ 2k < n`,
`f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p^n)`, and `v_p(f'(x)) = k`, then there is a
`y ∈ Z_p` such that

- `f(y) ≡ 0 (mod p^(n+1))`,
- `v_p(f'(y)) = k`,
- `y ≡ x (mod p^(n-k))`.

The proof takes `y = x + p^(n-k) z`, uses the Taylor expansion
`f(y) = f(x) + p^(n-k) z f'(x) + p^(2n-2k) a`, and chooses `z`
so that the first two terms cancel modulo `p^(n+1)`.

Theorem 1 then iterates this one-step improvement to obtain a Cauchy
sequence.  The multivariate case is reduced to the one-variable case by
varying only the chosen coordinate `X_j`.  Corollary 1 is the special
case `n = 1`, `k = 0`.

## Implemented in Lean so far

- project-local divisibility-depth predicate for congruences modulo `p^n`;
- one-variable and multivariate source hypothesis/conclusion predicates;
- one-coordinate update operation used in the multivariate-to-univariate reduction;
- helper lemmas extracting each source hypothesis/conclusion component;
- helper lemma that a correction of the form `x + p^(n-k) z` gives the required congruence.

Next proof target: formalize the Taylor-expansion congruence behind the one-step Newton improvement.
